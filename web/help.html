<h1>SongID User Guide</h1>

<p>
This is a quick reference for users of the SongID website. It's a project in
progress, so things may change, and I may not always update this guide
in a timely mannger. Please report bugs or other problems on the Live Filk list.
<p>
Note for filkers who have found this one way or another: This is an experimental
site for the Live Filk project, nichesourcing identification of song clips. If
you're interested, get in touch with Merav Hoffman or Gary McGath.
<p>
Note for anyone else coming here by accident: This is experimental software for use
within a small community. If you don't know us, nothing to see here, move
along, thank you.
<p>
Note for anyone coming here maliciously: There's nothing exciting
to grab here, just some short music clips by unknown performers, recorded
under hit-or-miss circumstances. Go away.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
To use this system, you must be a registered user. Go to the 
<a href="register.php" target="_blank">registration page</a> and enter your user name,
real name, and password, as well as a box to enter something about yourself that lets
us be sure who you are. If you
forgot your password, you can create another account. You'll initially be given
an inactive account that you can log into but not do anything with. Contact a superuser
to let them know you've registered and need to be activated.
<p>
There are four user roles: contributors, administrators, stakeholders, and superusers.
A user can have more than one role. An administrator can change your roles.
<p>
With the Contributor role, which all or almost all users will have,
you can listen to clips, enter information about them to
create a report, and view reports. You can't modify any existing information.
Users with the Administrator role can add clips, edit information about them, and delete reports.
Users with the Superuser role can delete users and modify their roles.
The Stakeholder role isn't actually implemented yet, but users with that role
will be able to hear clips and view reports in which they're named as performers,
composers, etc.
</p>
<h2>Entering information about clips</h2>
<p>
If you have the Contributor role, you can pick a clip to work on by going to the
<a href="cliplist.php" target="_blank">clip list</a>. You will see a table of all
the clips in the system. (A future version will paginate the list so you don't have
to deal with a huge table all at once.) If you want to see only clips that no one has
already produced a report on, click the "Show clips without reports" button. This will
change to "Show all clips" to let you switch back.
<p>
Each clip has two clickable links for contributors: "Create report" and "View reports." 
If you have the Administrator role, you'll see a third link, "Edit." 
<p>
Click on "Create report" for a clip, and you'll come to a page with a sound player
and a form. The form will change as you make selections. 
<p>
Start by playing the clip. If it won't play, it just has background noise, it contains
sensitive private conversation, or you have reason to think the performer didn't want
to be recorded, click "Flag this as something that should be removed" and click "Submit."
(A future version should add a "reason" field.)
<p>
Describe the clip as well as you're
able, then click "Submit" or, if you want to do more, "Submit and add another description."
If you prefer not to say anything on the clip, you can go back to "Clips" and try another.
</p>
<h2>Viewing reports</h2>
<p>
To view reports on a single clip, go to the clip list and click on "View reports" next to
the clip of interest. To view all clips, or all clips within a date range, Click on
"Reports" at the top of the page. You can select a start and end date.
</p>
<h2>Editing reports</h2>
<p>
You must have the Administrator role to edit clips. If you do, an "Edit" link will appear next
to each clip title. This will take you to the editing form, where you can change the
title and URL of a ciip. There's currently no way to delete a clip.
</p>
<h2>Adding clips</h2>
<p>
If you have the Administrator role, the clip list page will have an "Add new clip" button.
This will take you to a form where you can specify the URL and description of the
clip. Mentioning the place and time of recording is good if you know it. The
description can be up to 256 characters long.
